<h1>Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker</h1>

***Project Overview:***

This project focuses on measuring social media campaign performance primarily through two key metrics: clicks and impressions.

Impressions represent the total number of times the campaign content is displayed on users' screens, regardless of whether the user interacts with it. 

It indicates the potential visibility and exposure of the campaign to the audience.

Clicks measure the number of times users actively interact with the campaign by clicking on links, ads, or call-to-action elements. Clicks reflect actual engagement and interest generated by the content.

***Key Metrics:***

<b>CPM (Cost Per Mille or Cost Per Thousand Impressions):</b> CPM refers to the cost to show the ad one thousand times (impressions).

<b>CPA (Cost Per Acquisition or Cost Per Action):</b> CPA measures the cost to achieve a specific user action, such as a sale, sign-up, or download.

<b>Conversion Rate (CR):</b> Conversion rate is a key marketing metric that measures the percentage of users who complete a desired action or goal out of the total number of visitors or audience exposed
